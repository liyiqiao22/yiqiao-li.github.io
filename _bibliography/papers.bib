   abstract = {Drayage trucks play a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain, facilitating the movement of goods over short distances, typically between ports, rail yards, distribution centers, and other cargo-handling facilities. However, they are mostly powered by internal combustion engines and impact nearby communities with elevated noise and air pollution. This study proposes a drayage-focused truck data acquisition method that leverages existing infrastructures to provide a better understanding of drayage activities with the potential to support efficient policy-making. A single loop-based truck body type classification was designed with a specific focus on the identification of drayage trucks. The proposed model is capable of accurately distinguishing forty truck body type trucks with an average correct classification rate (CCR) of 81 percent. The model performance on drayage trucks (trucks hauling 20ft, 40ft, and 53ft intermodal containers) was improved over the weighted cross-entropy loss function without significantly compromising the model performance on other classes. The CCR value of drayage trucks is 91 percent which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models and has the potential to yield accurate real-world drayage truck activity metrics.},

   abstract = {The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) vehicle classification scheme is designed to serve various transportation needs such as pavement design, emission estimation, and transportation planning. Many transportation agencies rely on Weigh-In-Motion and Automatic Vehicle Classification sites to collect these essential vehicle classification counts. However, the spatial coverage of these detection sites across the highway network is limited by high installation and maintenance costs. One cost-effective approach has been the use of single inductive loop sensors as an alternative to obtaining FHWA vehicle classification data. However, most data sets used to develop such models are skewed since many classes associated with larger truck configurations are less commonly observed in the roadway network. This makes it more difficult to accurately classify underrepresented classes, even though many of these minority classes may have disproportionately adverse effects on pavement infrastructure and the environment. Therefore, previous models have been unable to adequately classify under-represented classes, and the overall performance of the models is often masked by excellent classification accuracy of majority classes, such as passenger vehicles and five-axle tractor-trailers. To resolve the challenge of imbalanced data sets in the FHWA vehicle classification, this paper constructed a bootstrap aggregating deep neural network model on a truck-focused data set using single inductive loop signatures. The proposed method significantly improved the model performance on several truck classes, especially minority classes such as Classes 7 and 11 which were overlooked in previous research. The model was tested on a distinct data set obtained from four spatially independent sites and achieved an accuracy of 0.87 and an average F1 score of 0.72.},

   abstract = {As light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology rapidly advances, it is becoming increasingly viable as a solution to collect vehicle classification data. The main challenge of LiDAR compared with video in vehicle classification lies in its resolution, which limits the ability of LiDAR-based models to classify vehicles in detail from a single captured frame. This article proposes a novel framework for reconstructing the vehicle point clouds generated by a roadside LiDAR sensor, by considering ground plane constraints and developing a bootstrap aggregating deep neural network (bagging DNN) model to classify the reconstructed vehicle point clouds, according to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) axle-based vehicle classification scheme. First, a probabilistic-based registration algorithm is used to estimate the transformation matrix between consecutive frames of each vehicle point cloud. Then, a multiway registration is conducted to fine-tune the estimated transformation matrices to rebuild the 3-D model of each moving vehicle. Second, key features are extracted from the reconstructed vehicle models and fed into a bagging DNN model to provide classifications based on the FHWA scheme. The classification model with the reconstruction framework outperforms the latest developed LiDAR-based FHWA classification model in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The model has an 83% average correct classification rate (CCR) on the test set. Remarkably, the proposed model can accurately distinguish Class 5 and 8 trucks, which have overlapping axle configurations, with a 97% and a 90% CCR, respectively.},

   abstract = {California possesses multiple major freight gateway and logistics facilities that serve both the state and the entire U.S. But the economic, environmental, and local community impacts of trucks, especially heavy-duty trucks that are currently essential to our supply chains and freight transportation system remain poorly measured due to the lack of comprehensive and detailed truck activity data. This paper describes the pilot implementation of the real-time, scalable, and cost-efficient Freight Mobility Living Laboratory (FML2). This system provides truck characterizations across multiple attributes, such as truck body types, axle-based and Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)-based classification and is currently deployed at 30 detection locations in Southern California along major freight corridors to support freight modeling and analysis needs. This paper details the design of the FML2 from edge data processing, predictive model development, communication architecture, and backend data storage to the real-time data dashboard to visualize the classification results. Three case studies have been presented at the end of the paper to demonstrate the potential of FML2 for use by both researchers and practitioners to gain further insights on truck activities.},

   abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of commercial vehicles is essential for facilitating strategic pavement design, freight planning, and policy making. Hence, transportation agencies have been increasingly interested in collecting truck body configuration data due to its strong association with industries and freight commodities, to better understand their distinct operational characteristics and impacts on infrastructure and the environment. The rapid advancement of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has facilitated the development of non-intrusive detection solutions that are able to accurately classify truck body types in detail. This paper proposes a new truck classification method using a LiDAR sensor oriented to provide a wide field-of-view of roadways. In order to enrich the sparse point cloud obtained from the sensor, point clouds originating from the same truck across consecutive frames were grouped and combined using a two-stage vehicle reconstruction framework to generate a dense three-dimensional (3D) point cloud representation of each truck. Subsequently, PointNet – a deep representation learning algorithm – was adopted to train the classification model from reconstructed point clouds. The model utilizes low-level features extracted from the 3D point clouds and detects key features associated with each truck class. Finally, model ensemble techniques were explored to reduce the generalization error by averaging the results of seven PointNet models and further enhancing the overall model performance. The optimal number of models in the ensemble was determined through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with the consideration of the average correct classification rate (CCR), the variability of the prediction results, and the computation efficiency. The developed model is capable of distinguishing passenger vehicles and 29 different truck body configurations with an average CCR of 83 percent. The average correct classification rate of the developed method on the test dataset was 90 percent for trucks pulling a large trailer(s).},

   abstract = {Restrictions on travel and in-person commercial activities in many countries (e.g., the United States, China, European countries, etc.) due to the global outbreak and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have severely impacted the global supply chain and subsequently affected freight transportation and logistics. This chapter summarizes the findings from the analysis of truck axle and weight data from existing highway detector infrastructure to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on freight trucking activity. Three aspects of COVID-19 truck impacts were explored: drayage, long and short-haul movements, and payload characteristics. This analysis revealed disparate impacts of this pandemic on freight trucking activity because of local and foreign policies, supply chain bottlenecks, and the dynamic changes in consumer behavior. Due to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, it is not yet possible to distinguish between transient and long-term impacts on freight trucking activity. Nonetheless, a future expansion of the study area and the incorporation of other complementary data sources may provide further insights into the pandemic’s impacts on freight movement.},
