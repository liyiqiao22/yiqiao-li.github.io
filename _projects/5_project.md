Description: This study provides a better understanding of the impacts associated with developing an inland port serving the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The team performs a comprehensive review of studies associated with inland ports within the United States and the rest of the world. This review provides insights on factors affecting the implementation, design, and operation of inland ports, and assesses the benefits and costs of developing inland ports to serve Californiaâ€™s major ports. As telematics data sources represent only a small sample of drayage truck activity, the next step is to enhance the ability to measure the impacts of current drayage truck activities on the metropolitan road network. TAMS coverage is being expanded in the Inland Empire with additional site deployments through a concurrent study. This study improves the accuracy of the truck classification model and yields a significant dataset of drayage truck activity in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Inland Empire to assess the potential impact of inland ports on highway congestion.
