Description: Pedestrians, bicyclists, and other non-vehicle occupants are considered vulnerable roadway users (VRUs), accounting for around 19 percent of crash fatalities. However, it remains a great challenge to accurately identify and analyze VRUs due to their inclinations to deviate from well-defined routes, resulting in limited data sources available to inform the development of effective signal control strategies for enhancing intersection safety. This study aims to design an AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning)-empowered data collection and analysis method by investigating and fusing two promising and complementary multimodal sensors, namely, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) Network Cameras. Great efforts will be made to devise effective visual, temporal, and 3-D point cloud data (PCD) ML, especially deep learning (DL), approaches, to accurately identify and analyze the nature and behavioral properties of pedestrians, cyclists, and various vehicle types, providing high-quality information inputs for effective strategic planning and thus enhancing intersection safety.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
