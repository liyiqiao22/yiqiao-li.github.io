Description: This study investigates the installation of LiDAR sensors along several locations along existing freeway corridors in side-fire and possibly overhead configurations.  Models are developed to obtain conventional (volume, speed and occupancy) as well as novel traffic stream parameters used in Caltrans traffic operations and compared with existing traffic sensors such as inductive loop detectors.  Concerns typically associated with side-fire sensors such as occlusions are investigated and alleviated by harnessing the wide field-of-view characteristics of LiDAR.
